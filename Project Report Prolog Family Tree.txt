Project Report: Prolog Family Tree Knowledge Base
1. Project Title
Family Tree Knowledge Base and Relationship Inference System

2. Overview
This project establishes a knowledge base using Prolog to define familial facts (gender, parent-child, spousal relationships) and a set of logical rules to infer complex family relationships (mother, father, sibling, grandparent, ancestor, etc.). The system allows a user to query for specific relationships between individuals within the defined family structure.

3. Knowledge Base (Facts)
The system is built upon a set of specific facts detailing the individuals and their direct relationships.

3.1. Gender Facts
Defines the sex of each named individual:

Males: mohan, vijay, sanjay, kiran, arjun, deepak.

Females: neeta, priya, rani, aisha, seem, rekha.

3.2. Hierarchical Facts
Defines the parent(Parent, Child) relationship:

mohan is the father of neeta and vijay.

neeta is the mother of priya and sanjay.

...and so on, establishing a four-generation structure from Mohan/Rekha down to Arjun, Aisha, Deepak, and Seem.

3.3. Spousal Facts
Defines the married(Person1, Person2) relationship (defined symmetrically):

mohan is married to rekha.

vijay is married to priya.

kiran is married to seem.

arjun is married to aisha.

4. Logic Rules (Inference Rules)
The core of the project is the set of logical rules that enable the system to infer relationships that are not explicitly stated in the facts.

Rule	Predicate	Definition
R1	mother(Mother, Child)	A parent who is female.
R2	father(Father, Child)	A parent who is male.
R3	grandparent(G, GC)	A person who is a parent of a parent of the grandchild.
R4	sibling(P1, P2)	Two distinct people who share the same parent.
R5	sister(Sister, Person)	A sibling who is female.
R6	brother(Brother, Person)	A sibling who is male.
R7	aunt(Aunt, Child)	A sister of the child's parent.
R8	uncle(Uncle, Child)	A brother of the child's parent.
R9	ancestor(A, D)	Defined recursively: an ancestor is a direct parent of the descendant OR a parent of an existing ancestor of the descendant.


5. Implementation and Execution
5.1. Programming Language
Prolog (Logic Programming)

5.2. Query Examples and Results
Query	Desired Output	Example Result (Based on KB)
Find the mother of Sanjay.	mother(M, sanjay).	M = neeta
Find all siblings of Vijay.	sibling(vijay, S).	S = neeta
Find all ancestors of Arjun.	ancestor(A, arjun).	A = rani, A = vijay, A = mohan
Find the aunts of Rani.	aunt(A, rani).	A = neeta (Neeta is the sister of Vijay, Rani's father).


5.3. Key Features
Declarative Programming: Relationships are declared, and the Prolog engine handles the traversal and logical inference.

Recursion: The ancestor rule effectively uses recursion to find relationships across multiple generations.

Consistency Check: The rules automatically ensure consistency (e.g., a mother must be both a parent and female).

6. Conclusion
The Prolog Family Tree project successfully demonstrates the power of logic programming in creating a robust and flexible knowledge base. By separating the explicit facts from the logical inference rules, the system efficiently determines complex, multi-step familial relationships based solely on the fundamental parent/2, male/1, and female/1 predicates. This forms a strong foundation for building more complex systems, such as genealogy databases or social network analysis tools.
